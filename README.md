# Marvel
Application to show info about Marvel Characters and apply different concepts and libraries to try them. This App is **under development.**


## Background

I am a Android Developer 
We're a small team of curious developers who are always trying to evolve and improve. 
As a result of my evolution as Android Developer I am developing this app to show me my skills and share them.

## Motivation

I'm been working with kotlin since the last year with this great [Book](https://leanpub.com/kotlin-for-android-developers) of [@lime_cl](https://twitter.com/lime_cl).
Since the first moment we've been greatly impressed with the language and his easy learn curve. Furthermore I'm a Marvel fan, so I decided create an Android Application
using clean Arquitechture based on [Helm Base Arquitecture](https://github.com/HelmMobile/KotlinCleanArchitecture) and trying some new things and libraries.

## Usage

**To run the application using real data obtained from the Marvel API create a ``local.properties`` file and add your public and private key from [Marvel API](https://developer.marvel.com/) there as follows:**

```
PUBLIC_KEY="YOUR_MARVEL_PUBLIC_KEY"
PRIVATE_KEY="YOUR_MARVEL_PRIVATE_KEY"
